You should have a directory similar to : C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Application Data\Subversion

In that directory there will be a file called servers.

I un-commented and edited the following entries and my subversion is now working fine with Eclipse:

http-proxy-host
http-proxy-port
http-proxy-username
http-proxy-password
